# GenRNA: Foundation LLM Models for RNA

This repository is part of an initiative to build foundational LLM models for RNA using the RNAcentral database. 

## Models

### BERT-like Model
The first model implemented is a BERT-like model trained using Masked Language Modeling (MLM).

## Next Steps
1. Implement autoregressive LLMs for RNA.
2. Explore discrete diffusion models for RNA.

## Data
The models are trained using data from the RNAcentral database - can be either donwloaded form HuggingFace or directly from source:

- https://rnacentral.org/help/ftp

## Installation
Instructions for setting up the environment and dependencies will be provided here.

## Usage
Examples and usage instructions for the models will be provided here.
